# SAYNA-UXUI-DESIGNPANTHER
Design UX/UI
A front-end developer needs to acquire UX/UI design skills. For this one, I used Figma, a tool widely used in design.
In this project, I created a wireframe and mocked up a website based on the Black Panther universe in desktop format.
In short, I had a lot of fun with this tool!
